# Python-Stopwatch
A python operated stopwatch, nothing revolutionary just a quick project.
Current version only works in Pycharm due to goofy goober letters and a error with the program closing immediately after finished which means it doesnt display the time on stopwatch.
A new version will be released shortly!
